# Sorting Library

A Rust library providing implementations of various sorting algorithms.

## Usage

To use this library, simply import the sorting algorithms in your Rust code:

## Sorting Algorithms

### Quick Sort

Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions an array into smaller sub-arrays and recursively sorts them.

### Selection Sort

Selection sort repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

### Insertion Sort

Insertion sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion of the array.

### Merge Sort

Merge sort divides the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them individually, and then merges them back together to form the final sorted array.
